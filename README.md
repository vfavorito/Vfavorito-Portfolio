# Vincent Favorito's Portfolio

### Overview:
In this repository I created my own Responsive Portfolio.  What I mean by responsive is the portfolio will change its appearance based on the size of the screen of the device viewing it! This was primarily accomplished using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.  The portfolio is made up of three seperate HTML pages that are linked to each other via a navbar on the top of the page.

## The Pages!
