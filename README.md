# Creating a Responsive Portfolio

## Vincent Favorito's Portfolio

### Overview:
In this repository I created my own Responsive Portfolio.  What I mean by responsive is the portfolio will change its appearance based on the size of the screen of the device viewing it! This was primarily accomplished using Bootstrap grids/breakpoints and Bootstrap components.  The repository is made up of three seperate HTML pages that are linked to each other via a navbar on the top of the page.

## Pages on small devices (screen widths of 575px or less)
### Index:

### Portfolio:

## Pages on all other devices (screen widths of 576px and up)
